Robusta
=======

Robusta, a programmatic bad smell detection tool, has been developed to help Java developers deal with 7 types of exception handling bad smells. Robusta is capable of detecting exception related bad smells namely, careless cleanup, over logging, exception thrown in finally block, empty catch block, unprotected main, nested try statement, and dummy handler.

Using Robusta user can add markers on the edit view for information of corresponding bad smells. It can also be utilized to refactoring certain types of bad smells or, more importantly, to generate reports for code quality visualization.

Our goal is to help Java developer reduce time effort on reviewing source code and improve code quality.
